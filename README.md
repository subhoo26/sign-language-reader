Itâ€™s a glove which reads sign language and display the output as an TTS in an Android Phone.

The primary form of communication used daily by deaf and mute persons is sign language. Speaking with disabled individuals can be challenging since a non-mute person cannot interpret their hand movements, and many silent people have hearing loss. Sign language tends to vary depending on the region, just as Sinhala, Tamil, English, or any other language. This essay aims to help deaf and mute individuals create a successful communication system with mute people. The finished product of this project combines a smartphone software that can convert sign language into digital voice with a light, wearable glove that can recognise 26 English words, numbers, and alphabet letters.
